# Philippines Tax Directory

A comprehensive tax directory and calculator for the Philippines, featuring modern UI, multiple tax types, forms library, filing calendar, and more.

## Getting Started

You can run this application in two ways: using Docker (recommended for beginners) or traditional Node.js setup.

### üê≥ Option 1: Docker Setup (Recommended)

#### Prerequisites
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (includes Docker Compose)
- Git

#### Quick Start with Docker
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ph-tax-directory
   ```

2. **Copy environment file:**
   ```bash
   copy .env.example .env
   ```
   *On Mac/Linux, use `cp .env.example .env`*

3. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   cd docker
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. **Access the application:**
   - **Main app**: http://localhost:5173
   - **With Nginx**: http://localhost:80 (if nginx service is enabled)

#### Docker Management Commands
- **Stop the application:** `docker-compose down`
- **View logs:** `docker-compose logs -f app`
- **Rebuild after changes:** `docker-compose up --build`
- **Run in background:** `docker-compose up -d`

#### Docker Services
- **app**: Main React application running on Vite dev server
- **nginx**: Reverse proxy for production-like setup (optional)

### üîß Option 2: Traditional Node.js Setup

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

#### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ph-tax-directory
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser and navigate to** `http://localhost:5173`

### üéØ For Beginners

If you're new to development, Docker is the easiest way to get started:

1. **Download Docker Desktop** from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
2. **Install and start Docker Desktop**
3. **Follow the Docker Setup steps above** - that's it!

No need to install Node.js, manage versions, or worry about dependencies. Docker handles everything for you!

## Available Scripts

### Docker Commands
- `docker-compose up --build` - Start application with Docker (from `/docker` folder)
- `docker-compose down` - Stop all containers
- `docker-compose logs -f app` - View application logs
- `docker-compose exec app npm install <package>` - Install new packages

### Node.js Commands (Traditional Setup)
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Docker Issues
- **"docker-compose not found"**: Make sure Docker Desktop is installed and running
- **Port already in use**: Change ports in `.env` file (APP_PORT, NGINX_PORT)
- **Permission errors**: On Linux/Mac, you might need `sudo` for Docker commands
- **Hot reload not working**: Make sure you're mounting the source code correctly (check docker-compose.yml)

### General Issues
- **Cannot access localhost**: Try http://127.0.0.1:5173 instead
- **Styles not loading**: Clear browser cache and restart the container
- **Build fails**: Delete `node_modules` and rebuild: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up --build`

### Getting Help
1. Check Docker Desktop is running
2. Ensure no other applications are using ports 5173 or 80
3. Try rebuilding: `docker-compose up --build`
4. Check logs: `docker-compose logs -f`

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
